### {{ page.title }}

Yep, I made another NBT crafting data pack for Minecraft 1.16. But this is different from others because the **Fabricator** behaves just as a **Crafting Table** does. Also it has a custom enchantment system, called **Spells**, they are used with a **Spell Caster**. 

The **Spell Caster** works similar to a **Enchanting Table** but you don't get to choose the spell you get, it is random but this randomness depends on how many spells are.

#### How to use the Fabricator

Use it as a regular **Crafting Table**, just don't leave anything in there, I still have to work on that.

#### How to use the Spell Caster

This requires **Lapis Lazuli** and **Paper**, if you put a regular paper on the top slot and lapis lazuli on the bottom slot you get a random spell or a **Broken spell**. If you put a **Spelled paper** on the top, lapis lazuli on the bottom and any item on the right slot the spell is aplied to that item. Currently this data pack does not check what item are the spells aplied (yes, you can apply a spell to a block).
