MCmake is a command line tool for making data packs that supports variables, conditions and loops. 

MCmake is intended to avoid coping entire commands over and over only to change a block id or a number. It first started as a template processor and it evolved to a sort of compiler. MCmake is available for Windows (as installer), MacOS (as stand alone file) and Linux (as a DEB package and stand alone file).
