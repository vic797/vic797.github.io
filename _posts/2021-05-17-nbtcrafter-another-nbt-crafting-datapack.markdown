#### {{ page.title }}

Yep, I made another NBT crafting data pack for Minecraft 1.16. But this is different from others because the **Fabricator** behaves just as a **Crafting Table** does. Also it has a custom enchantment system, called **Spells**, they are used with a **Spell Caster**.

The **Spell Caster** works similar to a **Enchanting Table** but you don’t get to choose the spell you get, it is random but this randomness depends on how many spells are.

By default this data pack only has four recipes and four items. To add custom recipes use the Web Tool.

#### How to use the Fabricator

**Crafting a Fabricator in a crafting table**

Use it as a regular **Crafting Table**, just don’t leave anything in there, I still have to work on that.

#### How to use the Spell Caster

This requires **Lapis Lazuli** and **Paper**, if you put a regular paper on the top slot and lapis lazuli on the bottom slot you get a random spell or a**Broken spell**. If you put a **Spelled paper**on the top, lapis lazuli on the bottom and any item on the right slot the spell is applied to that item. Currently this data pack does not check what item are the spells applied (yes, you can apply a spell to a block).

#### Trading Spells

You can trade spells from Cleric villagers at any price, this can be set on the web tool. The spell that villagers trade is as random as getting a spell from a Spell Caster.

#### Recipe Book
The recipe book works, it shows a list of all recipes in the chat with clickable links that show on a web tool the recipe.

#### Notes
Since this data pack uses barrels and droppers some redstone components are not allowed near this custom block. They get broken as soon as they are placed.

This blocks are not allowed near a Fabricator:

- Hopper
- Dropper
- Dispenser


This blocks are not allowed near a Spell Caster:

- Hopper
- Dropper
- Dispenser
- Repeater
- Comparator
- Redstone
- Observer
- Redstone Block
- Levers
- Buttons
- Pressure Plates
- Redstone Torches
