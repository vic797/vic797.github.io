**LoadJS** is a Javascript library that optimizes the loading process of a website by:

* Putting on queue the images so they load after the document,
* Improves the hash navigation (`href="#foo"`),
* Changes the DOM without reloading the website by changing the behavior of `a` tags with the `href` attribute,
   * `a` tags with the `onclick` attribute can suppress the LoadJS function by calling `LoadJS.preventLoad()` function.
   * Only `a` tags without the `target` attribute or with `target="_self"` are affected.
   * `a` tags with `href="#"` don't do anything.
* Keeps the history between reloads (pressing the `Reload` button or the `F5` key) using LocalStorage if possible,
   * If using LocalStorage is not possible then LoadJS uses cookies.
* Loads scripts and stylesheets as needed,
* Displays a loading screen as needed
